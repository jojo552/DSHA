## DSHA v0.1.7-alpha2 · GitHub pre-release

Published by contributor [@ym2025szz](https://github.com/ym2025szz). This is an experimental pre-release: DSH recently moved to **0.1.7-alpha.2**, changing session, agent-preset, plugin-manager and parts of the Web API contracts. Export important data and keep the backup password before updating. Legacy directory-style custom presets may need migration; see the [pre-release notes](docs/releases/v0.1.7-alpha2-pre-release.md) and [upstream migration discussion](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions/7545).

Standard adds an **experimental Android 11+ virtual screen** with ADB/Shizuku/Root channels, app selection and launch, in-app/optional floating preview, touch, keyboard input, AI actions and the accessibility tree. It can be affected by vendor ROMs and revoked permissions; **the Low build does not support virtual screen yet**. This release also fixes PiP streaming flicker, aligns data and backup entries, reduces Language dialog first-frame work, clears plugin-panel title space and updates the bundled mobile plugin.

## DSHA v0.1.6-alpha2.1 · Local delivery build 142

Build 141 fixes `DeepSeek Messages cannot represent user/tool-result content tool-call` when Agent Team, subagent delivery, or compaction replays a nested display-only tool call. System and user plugins now have separate ownership: backups retain user plugins and their dependencies, while system plugins retain only the user's enabled/disabled choice and always come from the current APK. Stale system-plugin entities leave the load path and are retained in quarantine. The proroot JSON `per-record` compatibility path is now V2 and no longer depends on unavailable directory-entry types or `lstat`. This build also removes the permanent block after 32 runtime trials and prevents regenerable WebView/cache `ENOTEMPTY` races from failing a format after core data has already been erased.

Bundled DSH remains **0.1.6-alpha.2**, Ubuntu base remains **10**, and the managed-runtime ID is `34a1cca8a112c4ec2695ba24e38a204c6266efca31dbd55017e1e66bc5fc1394`. DeepSeek Agent Team/compaction/direct tools/error and image results, plugins, backups, formatting, runtime rotation, and maintenance-process shutdown regressions passed. Both flavors passed 608 forced unit tests, Release Lint, E7E3-signed APK/ELF audits, and a non-destructive update on the user-selected M367FC/API 37 tablet; the same-name APKs in `release` have been replaced. This does not claim Android 6/7, every external model service, or every vendor device is covered.

See the [alpha2.1/build 142 changes and acceptance record](docs/releases/v0.1.6-alpha2.1-build142.md), the [build 141 changes and acceptance record](docs/releases/v0.1.6-alpha2-build141.md), the [build 140 proroot/plugin/device record](docs/releases/v0.1.6-alpha2-build140.md), and the [device UI gallery](ui-preview/native-ui-build135-review.html). The website package is prepared locally; the public website and GitHub Release have not been published. Automatic copies are local: export a copy and save its password before uninstalling.

## DSHA v0.1.5-rc2.1 — local delivery

Version code **131**. Both APKs are in the workspace `release` directory and retain the historical publishing certificate. Accepted builds replace the same-version APK under its regular filename; separate `-buildNNN` APK copies are no longer kept. Device acceptance now uses an in-place installation of the release build. This revision adds bounded network bridges and streaming proxy handling, frozen plugin dependencies with review and failure recovery, explicit credential error states, and retained-copy/read-only old-tree rescue management. The #65 / #67 fixes, native encrypted backups and managed runtime protections remain. It does not restore automatic backups or add automatic deletion. See the [delivery notes](docs/releases/v0.1.5-rc2.1-build131.md) and [itemized evidence and device limitations](docs/stability-acceptance.md). This build has not been uploaded to GitHub; the online release is described below.

## DSHA v0.1.5-rc2 — official release · Latest

Maintained and published by contributor [@ym2025szz](https://github.com/ym2025szz), with thanks to original author [@qiannianhuanxiang](https://github.com/qiannianhuanxiang) and the other contributors.

**[Latest official release](https://github.com/DSH-APP/DSHA/releases/latest)** · [Changes and comparison with previous releases](docs/releases/v0.1.5-rc2-notes.md) · [Verification record](docs/releases/v0.1.5-rc2-build129.md)

| Build | Devices | Download | Size |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Standard | Android 11+ / arm64, system WebView | [APK](https://github.com/DSH-APP/DSHA/releases/download/v0.1.5-rc2/dsha-0.1.5-rc2.apk) · [SHA-256](https://github.com/DSH-APP/DSHA/releases/download/v0.1.5-rc2/dsha-0.1.5-rc2.apk.sha256) | 176.69 MiB |
| Compatibility | Android 6+ / arm64, bundled Gecko fallback | [APK](https://github.com/DSH-APP/DSHA/releases/download/v0.1.5-rc2/dsha-0.1.5-rc2low.apk) · [SHA-256](https://github.com/DSH-APP/DSHA/releases/download/v0.1.5-rc2/dsha-0.1.5-rc2low.apk.sha256) | 253.23 MiB |

GitHub marks this as a **regular release / Latest**, retaining the tested APK name **0.1.5-rc2**, version code **129**, and original publishing certificate. Bundled dsh is **0.1.5-rc.2**; the Ubuntu base remains **10**. Both builds share the application ID and data.

### What's new

- **Consistent interface:** unified cards, buttons, dialogs, permissions and day/night themes; short-screen and large-font layouts; smoother page transitions. Installation and diagnostic logs scroll inside bounded panels, and the About dialog has clearer actions.
- **Separate terminal tabs:** PTY and simple terminals retain their processes, output and input across navigation, rotation and language changes. Display numbers reuse gaps; after closing all terminals, the next one is Terminal 1.
- **Chinese and English:** native screens, app statuses and both browser engines follow the selected language. Switching language keeps Web and terminal processes running; user text, commands, filenames and original third-party errors remain unchanged.
- **Plugins and presets:** working ascending/descending name sorting, enabled/update-first sorting, framed controls and bundled dsh-web-mobile 2.4.1-dsha.2. Four presets use real server confirmation; tablet controls sit on the right next to a working file button.
- **Browser and file compatibility:** fixes multiple-file selection loss (#64), older-WebView Iterator/PDF Worker initialization, and missing AbortSignal APIs before plugins load.
- **Startup and recovery:** port-conflict fallback, continued waiting for slow authentication, clearer failure records and an independent recovery screen. Fixes older tablet environment migration without discarding personal data.
- **Device access and networks:** consolidated capability grants, Shizuku manager discovery and reconnection for compatible forks, and DNS fallback for affected networks (#63), without replaying HTTP requests.

Compared with the preceding official release, this moves dsh to rc.2, adds the interface/terminal/language work and includes the subsequent compatibility fixes through build 129. Earlier refactor features—offline Ubuntu, model choices, file previews, backups, plugins and device channels—remain available. See the linked release notes for a version-by-version comparison.

### Upgrading and verification

Install over the existing app using the same signing certificate; keep a manual backup of important data. Base-10 environments update managed runtime files in place. Older base-9 environments first protect personal data before rebuilding; an Android 17 tablet completed this migration in testing. The full direct-upgrade matrix from 1.1.10 and earlier has not been revalidated.

Each build has **383 unit tests: 382 passed, 1 skipped, no failures**, and no Lint errors. Device checks include WebView 116, Gecko, multi-file callbacks, Shizuku reconnection, PDF Worker startup, and phone/tablet layouts. Android 6/7, real 16 KiB page-size devices and the actual thedjchi fork were not retested in this final round; fork support follows its public protocol.

The original documentation for **1.1.10 and earlier** follows unchanged. Its features, build instructions and compatibility claims describe those historical versions; use the official-release introduction above for the current version.

## What this is

DeepSeek Harness (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`) is DeepSeek's official agent harness — think Claude Code.
It targets glibc Linux, so running it on Android means hitting a wall of problems: native
modules that won't compile, `link(2)` blocked by SELinux, a sandbox that won't start,
a frontend laid out for desktops.

**DSHA packages all of that into one APK.** Install, paste your API key, press start —
no Termux, no root, not a single command. Inside is a complete Ubuntu 24.04 environment:
`apt` works, interactive PTYs work, native modules that need a compiler install fine.
It's the same thing you'd run on a server.

---

## Why DSHA

|  | |
|---|---|
| 🚫 **No terminal required** | The offline Ubuntu rootfs ships inside the APK. Nothing to install, configure, or type |
| 🐧 **A real glibc environment** | Not a trimmed-down one: `apt`, PTY, native modules, Python, git all present. Upstream plugins run unmodified |
| ⚡ **proroot: zero ptrace overhead** | Classic proot costs two context switches per syscall; proroot does in-process path translation via LD_PRELOAD + binary patching. Measured **+58%** across key operations on real hardware |
| 🔌 **ADB without Shizuku** | Wireless pairing and keep-alive are built in, so the agent can actually drive the phone — tap, screenshot, install apps |
| 💾 **Survives uninstall** | Conversations and settings live in `Documents/dshdata`, visible and backup-able from any file manager; the API key is encrypted with the Android Keystore |
| 🩺 **Tells you what broke** | 23 self-checks with one-tap repair, 15 self-healing scripts, and when the web UI won't start it names the plugin responsible |

---

## Get running in 30 seconds

1. Grab the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/qiannianhuanxiang/DSHA/releases/latest) (arm64 only)
2. First launch unpacks the bundled environment (a few minutes, once)
3. Paste your DeepSeek API key on the **Config** page → press start on the **Launch** page → the Web UI opens itself

That's it. If you'd rather see every step, use the step-by-step installer — each stage can be
reinstalled or updated on its own.

---

## What's in the box

DSHA isn't just "it boots". Everything below is implemented and shipping.

<details open>
<summary><b>① Environment &amp; installation</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Bundled offline rootfs | Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 inside the APK — full deployment works with no network |
| Step-by-step installer | rootfs / base tools / Node.js / harness as four independent stages, individually reinstallable, nothing downloaded twice |
| Parallel mirror benchmarking | Tsinghua, Aliyun, Huawei, Tencent, NJU, HIT, npmmirror… benchmarked in parallel, you pick from the results |
| Two install paths | Prebuilt package or from source; the source path handles native module builds (node-pty and friends) automatically |
| Verified as it goes | Every stage validates its own output — a half-finished install never reports success |
| Resumable | Fail or quit midway and you continue from that stage, not from scratch |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>② Runtime &amp; performance</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| proroot / proot | proroot by default (no ptrace overhead), switchable back to proot from Config |
| Measured gains | vivo V2352A / Android 14: +58% overall on key operations, +94% on tar (that's what backups use), +82% on stat-heavy work (node module resolution) |
| Three fallbacks | Missing runtime files → silently back to proot; three consecutive boot failures → forced switch with an explanation; installation always uses proot |
| Node.js 24 + pnpm | Same runtime as upstream |
| Foreground service | Status visible in the notification shade; Android won't quietly reap it |
| Watchdog | If the web process dies it comes back on its own |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>③ Data safety &amp; migration</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Uninstall-proof data | Sessions / settings / attachments live in `Documents/dshdata`, with private symlinks left in place |
| Encrypted API key | Android Keystore (AES/CBC), key never leaves the Keystore; the copy inside backups is encrypted too |
| Full backups | Manual backups rotate through 10 slots; automatic backups **alternate between two slots**, so a complete previous copy always survives |
| Backups explain themselves | Each archive carries `DSHA-README.txt`: what's inside, how to pull data out by hand, what won't survive a device change |
| Pre-restore inspection | The whole archive is read once, read-only — gzip's CRC catches truncation and corruption — and you're told how many sessions, how large, from which version |
| Very forgiving restore | Old backups are always accepted; missing plugins reinstall in the background; `link:` paths are rewritten across devices; local-path plugin sources are inlined into the archive |
| Post-restore migration | Version adaptation runs automatically (retire replaced built-in plugins, restore current ones) and the bridge token is realigned |
| Credentials excluded | The machine's bridge token is kept out of backups — archives land in a public directory and shouldn't carry this device's credentials |
| Corrupt session quarantine | Broken session files move to `corrupt-backup`, retrievable any time, so one bad file can't hold the whole UI hostage |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>④ Device control (let the agent actually use the phone)</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Wireless ADB, built in | Pairing and keep-alive included — **Shizuku not required**. The agent can tap, swipe, screenshot, install apps, read logs |
| Shizuku channel | Kept as an alternative path for users who already have it |
| App bridge (127.0.0.1:3090) | The agent can post system notifications, read device info, and ask you for confirmation |
| Dangerous-command gate | Commands that overwrite critical paths or delete recursively get held for approval, over **three channels** — notification, in-app dialog, or the floating bar |
| Streaming floating bar | Model output scrolls across the top of the screen like song lyrics; shows the actual command being run, reasoning optional; background colour, opacity, line count and dwell time all adjustable, with a preview |
| Built-in terminal | Drop straight into the Ubuntu shell — `apt install` whatever you need |
| Root-free file access | The MT Manager file provider is injected, so you can browse and edit the app's private directory from a file manager |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑤ Reliability: it tells you what broke</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| 23 self-checks + one-tap repair | Bridge, ADB, plugins, sessions, backups, runtime, public data, guard patches, web auth… each inspected, and whatever can be fixed is fixed on the spot |
| Plain-language plugin diagnosis | When the web UI won't start you get "it's plugin X, the service it wants doesn't exist, tap here to fix" — not a screen of Node stack traces |
| 15 self-healing &amp; patch scripts | pnpm shell restoration, bundle resolution repair, profile boot repair, `.l2s` chain flattening, session repair, dependency repair, filesystem write patches… |
| Signed incremental updates | Key scripts update from GitHub with **offline signature verification** (public key embedded; a bad signature rejects the whole batch), so fixes don't wait for a new APK |
| Failures written to disk | Backup, install and boot failures record their reason to a file that the self-check reads — "nothing happened" never stays unexplainable |
| CI gatekeepers | Every push runs Fast checks: manifest consistency, offline signature verification, 300 pure-logic assertions, and real compilation of every asset script. Releases abort outright on a certificate fingerprint mismatch |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑥ Network &amp; access</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Embedded WebView | GeckoView, so you're not at the mercy of the system WebView version |
| LAN access | Keep dsh on the phone, use it from a laptop or tablet browser. Token auth is fail-closed and sets a `SameSite=Strict` cookie on first hit so the token can't leak through outbound links |
| One-tap addresses | Copy the local or LAN URL (token included) from the launch page; refreshed by heartbeat |
| Old-browser polyfills | `AbortSignal.any/timeout` and `crypto.randomUUID` are injected automatically — the latter is mandatory over LAN HTTP, which is not a secure context |
| Configurable port | Set the web port yourself; conflicts fall back with an explanation |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑦ Plugin ecosystem</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Plugin marketplace | Browse, install, update, enable/disable, remove — all in-app |
| Mobile UI adaptation built in | Ships [dsh-web-mobile](https://github.com/mexiaosqwq/dsh-web-mobile) (MIT): single column on narrow screens, directory as a drawer, settings as a bottom sheet, status-bar safe area, readable tables and bubbles |
| Device skill guide built in | Tells the agent which device capabilities are available here |
| Hard dependencies rewritten | Plugins that hard-require a service get rewritten to runtime injection — one plugin should not take the whole plugin tree down with it |
| Built-ins protected | Built-in plugins can't be deleted by accident, and ones you disabled stay disabled across upgrades |
| Import / export | Plugin configuration can be exported and restored |

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>⑧ For developers &amp; agents</b></summary>

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | Entry document for AI and new contributors: structure, contracts, known traps — skip the full-repo scan |
| Agent skills | [`agent-skills/`](agent-skills/) ships `device-shell` (ADB / Shizuku bridge) and `screen-ocr-operator` (OCR + batched screen actions) |
| Pure-logic test suite | 300 assertions with no Android dependency; `bash tools/pure-logic-test.sh` finishes in seconds |
| Activity log | Key actions and failure reasons are recorded, so bug reports have something to stand on |
| Build entirely in CI | No computer needed: push a tag and a signed APK comes out, with an arm64 runner building the rootfs |

</details>

---

## How this compares

There are two ways to run dsh on Android. Both pay for something, and saying so is more
useful than trading labels:

| | **Container approach** (DSHA) | **Termux bootstrap approach** |
|---|---|---|
| Method | proot/proroot + full glibc rootfs | Termux packages running natively on Android bionic |
| Setup | Install an APK | Install Termux → type commands → install a toolchain |
| Environment | Complete Ubuntu; `apt` and native modules just work | Every native module needs a bionic patch or rebuild |
| Overhead | proroot has no ptrace cost | No container layer at all, theoretically fastest |
| Sandbox | Available | bubblewrap blocked by sepolicy, degrades |

Credit where it's due: the Termux side has come a long way.
[deepseek-harness-termux](https://github.com/Vengisk/deepseek-harness-termux) compiles node-pty
with exact upstream patches and swaps `link(2)` for `rename(2)` to get around SELinux;
[deepseek-harness-android](https://github.com/FunnelCakes/deepseek-harness-android) keeps a
genuinely useful compatibility matrix. "Termux builds are feature-crippled" is an outdated claim.

**DSHA's difference isn't that they can't run it.** It's that setup needs no command line,
the environment is real glibc rather than patches holding bionic together, and the app layer
brings things a script can't: direct ADB, the floating bar, the backup/restore system,
self-checks and self-healing, the plugin marketplace.

---

## Known limits

Listed up front so you don't discover them after installing:

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | ⚠️ arm64-v8a only | No 32-bit or x86 devices |
| OS | ✅ Android 8.0+ | Older versions untested |
| Download size | ⚠️ ~370 MB | The price of bundling a full Ubuntu — and what buys you the zero-setup install |
| bash sandbox | ⚠️ Unavailable | Android sepolicy blocks bubblewrap, so dsh runs with `danger-full-access`. Judge the risk yourself |
| Zhuoyitong / HarmonyOS anco | ❓ Unverified | Should work in theory, no device regression yet |
| Floating bar | ⚠️ Needs permission | Drawn with `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY`; the real status-bar ticker API isn't reachable without root |
| Data location | ⚠️ Needs file permission | If "All files access" is denied, data stays private and dies with uninstall (the self-check states which case you're in) |

👉 For **what each permission actually exposes and what the agent can reach on your phone**, see the [security model](docs/security-model.en.md) — including the weaknesses we list ourselves.

---

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────── APK ────────────────────────┐
│ Native Android (Java 17) · Material3 · GeckoView    │
│  ├ Launch / Install / Config / Workspace / Plugins  │
│  │   / Terminal / Settings                          │
│  ├ Foreground service + watchdog + notifications    │
│  ├ App bridge :3090    LAN bridge :3081             │
│  └ Floating bar (TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ proroot (default, no ptrace cost) / proot (fallback) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 · Node.js 24 · pnpm              │
│  └ @deepseek-ai/dsh  →  Web UI :3080                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Data: sessions / settings / attachments in `Documents/dshdata` (visible, backup-able).
`DSH_HOME` itself and `.credentials.yaml` deliberately stay private.

---

## Wireless ADB pairing (device shell)

Once paired, the agent can drive this phone directly — **no Shizuku needed**.

**First time (about a minute)**

1. Settings → About phone → tap "Build number" seven times to unlock developer options
2. Developer options → enable **Wireless debugging**
3. Open Wireless debugging → "Pair device with pairing code" → note the **IP:port** and the **6-digit code**
4. Back in DSHA → **Workspace** page → ADB section → enter both → pair

**After that** DSHA maintains the connection itself (keep-alive plus reconnect) and recovers
after a reboot. Nothing more to do.

**Verify**: run `adb shell id` in the built-in terminal; `uid=2000(shell)` means you're set.

**Give it to your agent**: copy the skills into your agent's skill directory:

```bash
cp -r agent-skills/device-shell ~/.agents/skills/
cp -r agent-skills/screen-ocr-operator ~/.agents/skills/
```

---

## Building

**In CI (recommended — no computer required)**

```bash
git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3   # triggers the release pipeline, signed APK comes out
```

Two stages: `ubuntu-24.04-arm` builds the rootfs natively on arm64 (cached), then
`ubuntu-latest` packs it into the APK and verifies the certificate fingerprint.
Pushing to `main` also runs a debug build plus Fast checks.

**Locally** (Gradle 8.5 + Android SDK + JDK 17)

```bash
./build.sh                      # needs app/src/main/assets/offline-rootfs.tar.gz first
bash tools/pure-logic-test.sh   # 300 pure-logic assertions, no device needed
```
